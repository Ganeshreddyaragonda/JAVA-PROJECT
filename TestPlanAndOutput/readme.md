## Instructions:
                         
This program will simulate a regular snakes and ladders game, where you will be       
facing the computer. You and the computer start at square 1, and the first one to     
square 100 wins, however, there will be preset squares which will be the snakes or ladders.
Once you land on top of a snake you go down a few squares, and move up if you land    
   on the bottom of a ladder. Good Luck and Have FUN!!!
